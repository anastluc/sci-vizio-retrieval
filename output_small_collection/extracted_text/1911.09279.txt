Abstract
Addressing students by their names helps a teacher to
start building rapport with students and thus facilitates their
classroom participation. However, this basic yet effective
skill has become rather challenging for university lecturers,
who have to handle large-sized (sometimes exceeding 100)
groups in their daily teaching. To enhance lecturers’ compe-
tence in delivering interpersonal interaction, we developed
NaMemo, a real-time name-indicating system based on a
dedicated face-recognition pipeline. This paper presents
the system design, the pilot feasibility test, and our plan for
the following study, which aims to evaluate NaMemo’s im-
pacts on learning and teaching, as well as to probe design
implications including privacy considerations.

Introduction
Teacher-student interpersonal relationship determines stu-
dents’ perceived closeness [17] to the teacher and thus
inﬂuences their engagement and performance in classroom

learning [4, 19, 18]. A classic yet effective way for teachers
to build up closeness to students is to address each indi-
vidual by their names [10, 5]. However, this skill becomes
rather challenging for nowadays university lecturers, given
the large number (sometimes exceeding 100) of students
in a class. Oftentimes, a lecturer could only remember a
few students’ names throughout a course period: affording
these students better chances for interactive participation in
the lecture and subconsciously missing personal engage-
ment with the rest of the students [24].
To tackle this substantial challenge, we explore a novel
technology that augments university teachers’ interpersonal
competence [26] in teaching large student groups. Namely,
we design NaMemo, an AR name-indicating system that
displays students’ names to facilitate a teacher to address
any student by their names during a lecture and eventually
improves the class quality and experience of both teachers
and students.
Enhancing teachers’ Interpersonal Competence
The framework of Classroom Assessment Scoring System
(CLASS) [11, 2] argues for emotional support, classroom
organization, and instructional support as three key aspects
of classroom quality. Regarding emotional support, a suf-
ﬁcient teacher-student rapport [24] is vital to effective and
enjoyable learning processes. Addressing students by their
names is the classic yet effective starting point of establish-
ing such a rapport [10, 5].
Research shows that students can beneﬁt from perceiving
that instructors know their names [5]. Knowing a student’s
name conveys the feeling that the teacher cares the student
and helps develop a sense of trust [27]; besides, it could in-
crease the chance that the teacher addresses the student
by name [23, 27]. However, it becomes especially challeng-
ing in university lecture settings, where nowadays teachers
have to cope with rather large classes (sometimes over 100
students in one class).
This challenge hinders a teacher from building a sufﬁcient
rapport with the students and affording each of them ad-
equate opportunities for active participation in the lecture.
We are therefore motivated to extend this interpersonal
competence of teachers through an interactive system.
Prior Designs for Supporting Teacher-Student In-
teraction in Classrooms
Much progress has been made in the design of tools to
enhance learners’ individualized [7, 20, 21], gamiﬁed [8],
or immersive [14] learning experiences.
Relatively, a smaller-but burgeoning-body of work has ex-
plored designs to enhance teacher-learner interpersonal
interaction in the classroom. Examples encompass orches-
tration tools [9], or peripheral data displays to ease teach-
ers’ interpersonal support [12], communication [22], or prox-
imity [3] to students. For instance, ClassBeacons [3] uses
ambient lamps in the classroom to depict how the teacher
divides time and attention over pupils in class to enhance
teachers’ real-time reﬂection on this important interpersonal
competence. Such systems are expected to enable effec-
tive learning environments by promoting teachers’ multi-
modal [15] and interpersonal interactions with students.
In this paper, we aim to contribute relevant insights in this
burgeoning area through the design and implementation of
NaMemo.
The Design of NaMemo System
The system consists of a pan-tilt camera (about 50 dollars)
ﬁxed on a tripod and a laptop (see Figure 1 and Figure
2). During the class, the system automatically recognizes




--- Page 3 ---

students and indicates the corresponding names on the
screen of the teacher’s laptop.
Figure 1: The prototype of our
NaMemo system in a real
classroom setting, highlighted in
red frames.
Figure 2: The pan-tilt camera used
in our NaMemo system.
To obtain clear images of all areas in the classroom (espe-
cially the back rows which are far away from the camera),
we choose a camera with a 35mm lens. However, this set-
ting cannot cover the whole classroom with a single image.
Therefore, we use a pan-tilt module to rotate the camera
and take multiple images (e.g., 63 images in our feasibility
test covering a 20m x 15m classroom). Given these images
from different rotation angles, we adopt image-stitching and
face recognition techniques, resulting in a panorama with
student recognition, as shown in Figure 3. The panorama is
updated every 90 seconds.
We build our recognition model on a convolutional neural
network integrating the state of the art techniques for face
recognition (i.e., mtCNN [28] and ArcFace [6]). The pipeline
in our approach includes three steps: face detection, face
alignment, and recognition by comparing with the database.
Our approach reaches 99.2% accuracy on the face recog-
nition task in our feasibility test with dense population and
large spatial distribution. The contribution of the algorithm
is not the focus of this paper, and we will present the details
elsewhere.
Pilot Feasibility Test
As a pilot, NaMemo was deployed in a university classroom
in China. A teacher participant used the prototype during
his lecture "Micro-controllers: Theory and Applications" with
161 students (in two classes) for ten lectures. All the stu-
dents were aware of the system’s deployment. No video
was recorded during the pilot. The pilot study was approved
by the local ethics committee in the university. The partici-
pants consented and were allowed to opt-out anytime dur-
ing the pilot. After using the prototype for ten lectures, we

conﬁdence levels above 0.8, while that in the yellow ones are
below 0.8 and over 0.5. When the cursor is located in a frame

of the window. The blue text is the translation.
used informal (ad-hoc) questionnaires and interviews (with
the teacher and ten students) to roughly probe its feasibil-
ity and preliminary user experiences. 159 (99%) informal
questionnaires were gathered from the students.
The questionnaire results may imply the feasibility of the
system: 151 students (95%) were satisﬁed with the deploy-
ment of the system. As a reference of how the teacher in-
teracted with the students during the pilot, 97 students were
called and all of their names were used correctly. Students’
also reported their experiences of the pilot lectures: e.g.,
perception of the teacher being more approachable (75%),
or themselves being more concentrated during lectures
(78%). Although this might imply some potential beneﬁts
of the system, they are to be further veriﬁed or falsiﬁed in
future research.
During the interview, we asked the teacher and ten ran-
domly selected students about their opinions and concerns
about the system. The teacher thought NaMemo could
"improve the in-class efﬁciency" by replacing his task of




--- Page 4 ---

checking a name list to call some students’ names, which
can interrupt his workﬂow. The Interviewed students felt
they became more focused during the class session (know-
ing that the teacher might call their names), and they felt
they could be more active in the class ("I might be able to
have more interactions with the teacher"). Although the stu-
dents were informed that system was only used to indicate
names, some students still asked if it was used for checking
attendance. After extra explanation, the interviewed stu-
dents relieved the concern. This suggests the importance
of further probing the privacy issues and design solutions
for such systems [16].
Discussion and Future Work
A formal, larger-scale evaluation of NaMemo will be carried
out in the future, in which the following aspects could be
critically examined:
Teacher-Student Interaction. Our direct goal of devel-
oping the NaMemo system is to increase teacher-student
interaction in class. In our next study, a between-subject
set-up will be adopted to study the effects of NaMemo on
two types of interaction: the teacher calling students’ name
to ask a question (or for other reasons), and students ask-
ing questions to (or requesting attention from) the teacher.
Classroom Learning-Quality. Ultimately,we are interested
in how the system inﬂuences students’ learning quality,
which could be moderated by teach-student interaction. As
found by Deslauriers et al. [7], students’ perceived learning-
quality could be different from their actual learning-quality.
Therefore, we will measure students’ learning-quality both
objectively and subjectively [7].

Teachers’ Memorization of Students’ Names. Besides
indicating students’ names on the spot, we wonder whether
the system could also improve teachers’ memorization of
students’ names via more frequent interaction with stu-
dents, or, whether it only ofﬂoads teachers’ memory and
raises their dependency.
Students’ Privacy. Importantly, we plan to critically probe
the privacy concerns and ethical issues of using such com-
puter vision systems in classrooms [16, 1]. While related
reﬂections have concerned the western classroom contexts
[16, 1], fewer insights are generated in eastern classroom
contexts. Since no standard instrument is known for pri-
vacy evaluation of classroom technologies, we will develop
ad-hoc questionnaires, based on related instruments (e.g.,
students’ perceived control from the teacher from QTI [25]).
Education Experts’ Opinions. Besides the perception of
the students and teachers, the opinions from education ex-
perts are necessary to deepen the insights of our study. We
plan to cooperate education experts in our study to evalu-
ate the potential beneﬁts and risks of the system in different
perspectives.
Using Smart Glass as the User Interface. In future devel-
opment, we would like to explore integrating NaMemo sys-
tem with a smart glasses interface. Using smart glasses,
teachers could get the digital information simultaneously
when observing the classroom, without moving their focus
away from the students (e.g., see the Lumilo project [13]).
Conclusion
The proposed NaMemo system is in its early stage of ex-
ploring technologies supporting teacher-student interaction
in class. Therefore, the system is simplistic, and extra func-
tions remain to be implemented. In our future work, we aim
to contribute to the HCI community by designing and evalu-
ating new interfaces based on the system to support teach-
ers’ interpersonal competence during classroom teaching.
